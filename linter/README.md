# File I/O


## JavaScript Linter
 Write a method that reads a JavaScript file with a given Path, and generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.

the message error Dose Not show when : 
- the line is empty.
- the line ends with an opening curly brace {
- the line ends with an closing curly brace }
- if the line contains if or else
  
  ## You have to :
- Call that method in your main method on the file gates.js.
- Print out the resulting error message.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for the map methods.
- Use JUnit to write a test for the linter.
You’ll need to create a JS file that will test each of these things!



***Note that for your test you have to***


- Test the linter on a file that contains no errors.
- Test the linter on a file that contains one error.
- Test the linter on a file that contains few errors.
- Test the linter on a file that contains many errors.
- Test the linter on an empty file.
